Welcome to harmony-py's documentation!
======================================

`harmony-py` is a Python library for integrating with NASA's `Harmony <https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/>`_.

`harmony-py` is an alternative to `Harmony's RESTful API <https://harmony.earthdata.nasa.gov/docs/api/>`_ and also handles NASA `Earthdata Login (EDL) <https://urs.earthdata.nasa.gov/home>`_ authentication and optionally integrates with the `CMR Python Wrapper <https://github.com/nasa/eo-metadata-tools>`_ by accepting collection results as a request parameter. It's convenient for scientists who wish to use Harmony from Jupyter notebooks as well as machine-to-machine communication for larger Python applications.

`harmony-py` is a work-in-progress, is not feature complete, and should only be used if you would like to test `harmony-py` functionality.
